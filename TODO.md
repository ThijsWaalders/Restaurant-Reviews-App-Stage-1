# TODO list for: The Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1

- [ ] Clone the [starter repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1)
- [ ] Get your [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and replace YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY on line 37 of index.html with your own key.
- [ ] Convert the provided site to use a responsive design.
    - [ ] Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used; all responsiveness should be done with CSS.
    - [ ] Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags
    - [ ] Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS
    - [ ] Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes
    - [ ] Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device
- [ ] Implement accessibility features in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions).
- [ ] Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline. Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.
